----------------------------------------

Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change.

Open/Closed Principle: Software entities (classes,modules,functions) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substituable for their base types without altering the correctness of the program.

Interface Segregation Principle: A class should not be forced to implement interfaces it does not use.

Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.

------------------------------------------

Singleton: One Instance // considired as anti pattern

Simple Factory: Centralized object creation  // most people say its not a design pattern

Factory Method: Subclasses create objects

Abstract Factory: Families of related objects

Builder: Step-by-step construction

Prototype: Clone existing objects

Object Pool: Reuse and manage instances
